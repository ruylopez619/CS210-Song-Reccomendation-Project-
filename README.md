# CS 210 Spring 2021 - Project Subjects
Dear students, please refer to this document for selecting your course project. Each
project subject is listed with the expected responsibilities & outcomes for different group
sizes. Please note that these responsibilities and expectations are cumulative. This means
that your group is expected to address the tasks given for groups of lesser people. To give
a concrete example, if your group consists of 4 or 5 students, you are also expected to
complete tasks of single-sized and 2-3 students sized groups. However, you can focus
more on tasks specified for your group size.
In the lecture, we will go over an example project prepared for one of the previous
semesters of this course. You can consider the layout presented in that notebook as an
example layout for your projects as well. Projects in this course consist of three sections
which can be named Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing,
and Machine Learning section. You can consider these sections as milestones of your
projects and expect deadlines for each of them as we progress through the semester.
Some Clarifications About Projects:
- We expect you to work on IPython notebooks and present your work through a
singular IPython notebook file. This means, as a group, you will work on and
populate a single IPython notebook file as we progress. The final report of your
group will be the IPython notebook of your project consisting of all of the sections
listed above.
- We expect clear presentations in IPython notebooks. This means that we will not
only evaluate your efforts on coding/implementations but also the structure of
your notebook. To have a notebook with higher readability and better structure,
please use markdown texts when necessary.
- As previously announced, for each milestone submission, one of your project
members will prepare a short video presentation describing the current iteration of
the project.
- You are welcomed to revise (or introduce modifications to) the tasks given your
projects. However, please contact TAs for their approval before introducing
changes to given problem definitions.
- Please do not hesitate to reach out TAs for any questions about the project. You
can also ask your project related questions in office hours.

Project 1: Spotify Song & Genre Analysis, Popularity
Prediction and Building a Simple Recommendation
System
The main dataset, Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks, for the project can be found from
Kaggle.
Project Description:
As the dataset provides many songs with pre-calculated features along with the genre
information, there is a great potential to analyze how these features change with different genres.
Groups with more number of students can also focus on building a simple recommendation model
based on feature similarities of songs in the dataset. As the dataset spans over a long time, how the
features of genres change over time can be analyzed at both Exploratory Data Analysis and
Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing sections.
Below, expected tasks are summarized for each group size.
Exploratory Data Analysis
A- For 1 Student Projects;
- Visualizations descriptive statistics of the dataset; visual explanations of features &
sharing distributions,
- Example visualizations of aggregated forms based on features (One example can be
grouping the dataset based on genres and comparing distributions or centrality metrics of
features for different genres),
- Analysis of the most popular artists and songs.
B- For 2-3 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A
- Analyzing how songs of different genres change with time (Temporal analysis of features)
C- For 4-5 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A and B
- Comparison of features of sub-genres for selected parent genres over time periods
Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
A- For 1 Student Projects;
- Statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute to popularity of songs
B- For 2-3 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A
- Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras (like
comparing features of 80s and 90s hip-hop)
C- For 4-5 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A and B
- Statistical tests on sub-genres (investigating if there are significant statistical differences
in features of different sub-genres of the same parent genre, eg. comparing features of
british rock and anadolu rock songs)
Machine Learning
A- For 1 Student Projects;
- Prediction of song popularity with various machine learning models
- Efforts on hyper-parameter tuning to increase the performance of models
B- For 2-3 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A
- Creating a simple song recommendation system (The system can work as accepting a list of
songs as input and returns a selected number of songs similar to the ones given in the
input) using similarity metrics and Nearest Neighbors methods
C- For 4-5 Student Projects;
- All requirements listed in A and B
- Song clustering based on available features and trying to relate them with existing genres
